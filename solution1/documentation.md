## Problems I Met and Solutions

### Environment Issues
1. **Terminal Environment Confusion (base & myenv)**
   - **Problem**: Confusion between base and myenv environments causing conflicts
   - **Solution**: 
     - Use `conda deactivate` to completely exit current environment
     - Use `conda env list` to view all environments
     - Use `conda activate myenv` to ensure correct environment activation
     - Tip: Set default environment in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

2. **FFmpeg Dependency Missing**
   - **Problem**: Initial run failed due to missing FFmpeg
   - **Solution**:
     ```bash
     # For Mac users
     brew install ffmpeg
     
     # For Ubuntu users
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install ffmpeg
     
     # For Windows users
     # Download from official website and configure environment variables
     ```

### Exploration and Findings

#### Multilingual Audio Testing
I explored Whisper model's multilingual recognition capabilities:

1. **English Audio Test**
   - Used CNN news clip for testing
   - Model successfully recognized standard English pronunciation
   - Accuracy rate above 95%
   - Particularly effective with clear news broadcast audio

2. **Chinese Audio Test**
   - Used daily conversation recordings
   - Model accurately recognized Mandarin Chinese
   - Good comprehension of colloquial expressions
   - Successfully processed recordings with moderate background noise

#### Why Test Different Languages?
1. **Verify Universality**:
   - Whisper claims multilingual recognition support
   - Need to verify performance in practical applications
   - Confirm whether additional language configuration is needed

2. **Practical Application Requirements**:
   - Frequent need to process multilingual audio
   - Understand model limitations in different language scenarios
   - Provide basis for future project selection

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Compare recognition accuracy across languages
   - Assess processing speed differences
   - Understand resource consumption patterns
